      <description>&lt;p&gt;Detection of a drivable space is a key step in the
autonomous control of a vehicle. In this paper we propose an
adaptive vision based algorithm for road detection in diverse
outdoor conditions. Our novel approach employs feature based
classification and uses the Kohonen Self-Organizing Map
(SOM) for the purpose of road detection. The robustness of the
algorithm lies in the unique ability of SOM to organize
information while learning diverse inputs. Features used for the
training and testing of SOM are identified. The proposed
method is capable of working with structured as well as
unstructured roads and noisy environments that may be
encountered by an intelligent vehicle. The proposed technique
is extensively compared with the k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
algorithm. Results show that SOM outperforms KNN in
classification consistency and is independent to the lighting
conditions while taking comparable classification time which
shows that the network can also be used as an online learning
architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
